        Good day,
        <br>
        <br>
        This message is in regards to your <b>{{ $itempurchased }}</b> engine computer. If you would please confirm your VIN number; the VIN # we have on record for you is <b>{{ $customervin }}</b>. Upon review of your VIN number you provided, you need part number {{ $wrongpart }} which is a different part than what you ordered and that we can guarantee will work. There is a <u>price increase</u> of <b>${{ $pricepaid }}</b> that would need to be paid, if you want to go with the part number that your VIN is showing. Please confirm your VIN and which part you would like us to program, test and ship out to you at your earliest convenience. If you have any additional questions always feel free to contact us.
        <br>
        Thank you so much for your order with us!
        <br>
        <br>
        Best regards,
        <br>
        FlagshipOne Inc.
